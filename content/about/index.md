title: About me
---


I'm a R&D engineer working at [Amossys](https://www.amossys.fr/) which is a cyber-security company in Rennes (Britanny, France). 

I recently defended my PhD thesis (December 2019) 
which was under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Alexandre Termier at IRISA/Inria Lab. 
I mainly worked on new statistical methods for data mining
with some applications to intrusion detection.

Henceforth, I'm working on security R&D projects but I also keep on working on my research topics, mainly around unimodality testing and clustering.
