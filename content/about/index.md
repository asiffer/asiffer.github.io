title: About me
---


I'm CTO @ [Situation](https://www.situation.sh). We develop an IT data platform that collects, stores, enriches and makes available IT data through a simple REST API ("IT data" is a suitcase word to denote every piece of information living on IT infrastructure: laptop, server, container, config, account, IP address ...). 

I "recently" defended my PhD thesis (December 2019) 
which was under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Alexandre Termier at IRISA/Inria Lab. 
I mainly worked on new statistical methods for data mining
with some applications to intrusion detection.

Henceforth, even if I mainly work on engineering stuffs I also keep on working on my research topics, mainly around unimodality testing and clustering.
