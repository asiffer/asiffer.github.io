I'm a R&D engineer working at <a href="https://www.amossys.fr/">Amossys</a> which is a cyber-security company in Rennes (Britanny, France). 

I recently defended my PhD thesis (December 2019) 
which was under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Alexandre Termier at IRISA/Inria Lab. 
I mainly worked on new statistical methods for data mining
with some applications to intrusion detection.

Henceforth, I'm working on security R&D projects but I also keep on working on my research topics, mainly around unimodality testing and clustering.

<!-- My thesis deals with **cyber-attacks detection with statistical learning methods**. The idea is to bridge from AI to cyber-security (I apologize for these run-of-the-mill keywords).
Actually, I have rather developed generic algorithms which may then be used in cyber-security. -->
