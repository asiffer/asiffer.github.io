          We detail how we detect desktop components on screenshots. The method we present is a part of our final solution that made us win the ECW2020 challenge.

          Yes, the most famous network scanner embeds Machine Learning. Really? A deep neural network with many scientific keywords ? Not at all, I&#39;m more talking about *grandpa* machine learning. Let us discover it!

      <title>Fancy Threat Intel&#39; with Cowrie/MySQL/Grafana stack</title>

          We all dream of this world map with cyber attacks between countries like this one or the one of Kaspersky. In this post, we will try to do threat intelligence at our modest level. We will consider a basic system open on the Internet, in the grip of cyber-attackers. In this context, we will collect attacks information so as to make a fancy dashboard to visualize what is going on.

      <title>Distribute your work with Git and Launchpad</title>

          Introduction Let us consider you have developped a nice tool (or a nice library). You make it work on your laptop but, more than that, you put all your code on GitHub of GitLab, for instance. As you are smart, you made a useful Makefile so as to help others to use your work through the famous process:
git clone https://remote.site/mytool.git cd mytool/ make make install However, it looks a bit handmade: of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a computer science expert to enter these commands, but this is not as easy as installing an app on your smartphone.

          I&amp;rsquo;m a R&amp;amp;D engineer working at Amossys which is a cyber-security company in Rennes (Britanny, France).
I recently defended my PhD thesis (December 2019) which was under the supervision of Pierre-Alain Fouque and Alexandre Termier at IRISA/Inria Lab. I mainly worked on new statistical methods for data mining with some applications to intrusion detection.
Henceforth, I&amp;rsquo;m working on security R&amp;amp;D projects but I also keep on working on my research topics, mainly around unimodality testing and clustering.

          My researches mainly focus on statistical learning. As cyber-security is a hard context (high throughput data, lack of ground truth), I try to develop unsupervised methods to mine streaming data.

          In addition to the research, we try to cleanly distribute our work. You could find several projects on my github, some debian packages on my ppa and also some python3Â packages on PyPI, all with GPLv3 license. Below we detail some of them.
Research related  netspot We have built an network IDS (Intrusion Detection System) upon the SPOT algoritm, called netspot. The idea is to flag extreme events whike monitoring netwrok statistics.
