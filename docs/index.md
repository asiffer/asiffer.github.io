Hi , I am Alban Siffer +twemoji:waving-hand+, kind of *generalist*. I love maths (analysis, probabilities & statistics) and dev (`Python`, `Go`, `C`, `TypeScript`) with cybersecurity in mind. I like reflecting on the whole chain, from theory to real-world deployment.

Currently, I am CTO of [situation.sh](https://www.situation.sh), where we build an [IT data collection infrastructure](https://data.situation.sh/howto). I am also maintainer of some open-source projects:

- [mkdocs-shadcn](https://github.com/asiffer/mkdocs-shadcn) - A [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) theme based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Yes these pages are made with it!
- [libspot](https://github.com/asiffer/libspot) - A C library to flag extreme events (outliers) in streaming data.
- [puzzle](https://github.com/asiffer/puzzle) - A Go library to manage configuration (it autogenerates the bindings you need like to populate it at runtime: CLI flags, env, config files...)
- [svgg](https://svgg.vercel.app) - An app that turns any svg into image link (nice when you can only provide url, like Notion)
- ... and many others you may find on [my repos](https://github.com/asiffer?tab=repositories)


Finally, I keep on working on my old PhD unsolved problems (mainly unimodality testing). Things I won't be able to remove from my head until solved +twemoji:grinning-face-with-sweat+.
